# benchmark-markdown-priority
30 minute initial pseudocode pass on benchmarking ai's ability to prioritize text

## TODO
1. Need to define what `importance` means in some way that lets it dictate priority that the AI utilizes that in its decision making*
2. Say something like "this is written in a language you don’t understand, use markdown syntax as a clue to determine the importance of each line"
3. I don't think this is the correct approach, it should probably e.g. write a script hook based on this format or w/e the goal output is
  - ask for a DAG response instead of "weights"
4. Test JSON format as well, it's likely even better.
